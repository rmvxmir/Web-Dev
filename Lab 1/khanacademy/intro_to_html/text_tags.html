        Nobody’s born smart. <strong>We all start at 0.</strong> Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra. <br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong> <br>
        There was a time when Einstein <em>couldn’t count to 10.</em> <br>
        And Shakespeare <em>had to learn his ABCs</em> just like the rest of us. <br>
        Thankfully, <strong>we are born to learn.</strong> <br>
        Slowly. Surely. You <em>stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail</em> and <strong>fall.</strong> <br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling. <br>
        Until one day, <strong>you walk.</strong> <br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next. <br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger. <br>
        <em>Failing</em> is just another word for <strong>growing.</strong> And you keep going. <br>
        <em>This. is. learning.</em> <br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <strong>yet.</strong> <br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe <br>
        are built on <strong>basic ideas</strong> that anyone, anywhere can understand. <br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
        You only have to know one thing: <br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
